# third-task-
In this profession, the requirements were:
1- The design of the robot suspension system
2- Calculating the position of the end effector
3- Install the wheels for the robot
4 - leg cover design
But I was late in this task because because of the leg cover when converting it from stl to solidwork files there was an error and I asked the trainers but no one answered I will try to design a leg cover from a design and try to deliver it with the next missions
